<h1 align="center">Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
  
 I am an undergraduate student at University of Alberta, learning and developing software to make impact, one step at a time. Ever since I wrote my first program, I was fascinated by the computers and their power to impact society today. I have developed numerous projects over the years and have a number of skills to offer. But my best skill is my ability to tear through new concepts and tools and in order to solve challenges.
